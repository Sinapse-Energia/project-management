# project-management
Explanation of how are managed the Sinapse projects based on github repositories. The management will as agile as possible

# Overview

Due to the complexity of the projects and the worldwide ressources involved in the development it is necessary to implement an agile project management system in order to get the work done in a sustainable way. 

It will be implemented a kind of SCRUM management system that will be very basic at first and then will be growing in complexity if it required. 

# Building blocks

The management system is based in the following blocks or pillars

## Roles

### Product Owner
Responsible of the product, project or development. 

### Scrum Master

### Developers


## Wiki

The documentation of the project will be written in the wiki of the repository. The Wiki is like a functional requirements + technical requirements dossier. 

In the wiki it is explained the global view of the project to be developed, then the concrete work to do will be explained in the tasks

## Tasks / Issues

They are the base of any development project. Any kind of development will be splitted in simple tasks in order to ease the development and also the planification and management of the features. The tasks should be as simple as possible, if a task is very extense or complicated they should be devided into several more simple tasks: Divide and Conquer!

Each task contains always minimum 4 labels providing *Type*, *Priority*, *Size* and *Status*

*Type*: Indicates what kind of task is, like bug, feature, design or enhancement. Set by the Scrum Master
*Priority*: There are three priorities: Low, Normal and High. If a developer has several tasks assigned in the same milestone, it should focus at first in the High priority tasks. Set by the Product Owner and Scrum Master
*Size* or story points: It is a relative measurement related with the complexity and necessary time to be invested in order to finish it. It is a tool that try to ease the stimation. To stimate using time is not very exact and normally the stimations never works. The sizes normally maps a interval of time, but not always. Set by the Scrum Master and Developers
*Status*: Indicates how is the task at the current moment. Set by Scrum Master and Developers
